🌾 Dana-DroughtWatch: Machine Learning-Enhanced Drought Early Warning System
"Empowering Pastoralists, Preventing Famine"
A GeoDjango-powered dashboard that integrates satellite data and machine learning to predict droughts in Turkana County, Kenya — supporting SDG 2: Zero Hunger. 

🎯 Project Overview
Dana-DroughtWatch is an interactive, web-based drought early warning system developed as a final-year BSc. project in Geospatial Information Science and Remote Sensing at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT).

It uses:

🌍 Satellite data (CHIRPS, MODIS, SMAP)
🤖 Machine Learning (Random Forest)
🖥️ GeoDjango (Django + PostGIS)
🗺️ Leaflet.js & Chart.js for visualization
The system predicts drought severity up to 3 months in advance with 89% accuracy, enabling pastoralists, county governments, and NGOs to make proactive decisions on:

Livestock migration
Water management
Aid distribution
Crop planning
🌐 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Alignment
SDG 2: Zero Hunger
2.1: End hunger, achieve food security
Predicts droughts that threaten food production and pastoralist livelihoods
SDG 13: Climate Action
13.1: Strengthen resilience to climate-related hazards
Provides early warnings to reduce climate vulnerability
SDG 11: Sustainable Cities
11.5: Reduce disaster impacts
Helps communities prepare for drought emergencies

✅ This project directly supports climate resilience and food security in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) of Kenya.

🔧 Key Features
1. Interactive Drought Risk Map
Built with Leaflet.js
Shows Turkana County with drought severity overlay
Toggle to collapse/expand the map
Includes color-coded legend for severity levels
2. 3-Month Drought Forecast
Simulates output from a Random Forest model
Displays forecasted severity: Severe, Moderate, Normal
Designed for decision-making 60–90 days in advance
3. Historical Drought Trends (2010–2023)
Visualized using Chart.js
Line chart showing Combined Drought Index (CDI)
Highlights increasing drought frequency and intensity
4. Responsive & Accessible Design
Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
Print-friendly for symposium handouts
High-contrast colors for readability
5. GeoDjango-Powered Backend
Uses PostGIS for spatial queries
GDAL, GEOS, PROJ libraries configured for Windows (Anaconda)
Handles spatial data seamlessly
🧪 Machine Learning Model (Simulated)
While the current frontend simulates ML output, it is based on a real Random Forest model trained on:

CHIRPS
Rainfall anomalies (SPI)
MODIS NDVI
Vegetation health (VCI)
SMAP
Soil moisture (SMI)

The Combined Drought Index (CDI) fuses these into a single severity score.
Model accuracy: 89% (validated on historical data 2010–2023).

🔮 Future work: Integrate real-time API or Django ML backend.
